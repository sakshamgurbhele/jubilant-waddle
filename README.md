## What Is This

AI-Powered Job Search turns Claude Code into a full job search command center. It is not a keyword-matching job board scraper. It is an AI reasoning pipeline that reads your CV and evaluates whether a role is genuinely worth your time.

**What it does:**

- Evaluates job offers with a structured 6-block scoring system driven by AI reasoning against your actual CV
- Generates ATS-optimized CVs tailored per job description, rendered as polished PDFs
- Scans 45+ company career portals and job boards automatically
- Pre-generates answers for application forms so applying takes minutes, not hours
- Detects ghost jobs, tracks funding signals, and surfaces companies likely to hire before postings go live
- Tracks everything in a single source of truth with pipeline integrity checks

**Why it is different:**

| Typical job search tool | AI-Powered Job Search |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Keyword matching | AI reasoning against your actual CV |
| Volume-focused | Quality-first — recommends against anything below 4.0/5 |
| You fill forms manually | Answer bank pre-generates 25 standard answers once |
| Static job alerts | Funding radar finds companies before jobs are posted |
| Expensive at scale | 3-tier model routing: $2.72/month for 205 jobs |

**Human-in-the-loop by design.** The system evaluates, recommends, and prepares — but never submits an application without you reviewing it first. You always have the final call.

> The system gets smarter the more context you give it. Think of onboarding a new recruiter: the first week they need to learn about you, then they become invaluable.

**Real numbers from a live run:** 210 jobs evaluated, 61 CVs generated, 3 scheduled daily LinkedIn scans (9am/3pm/6pm ET), 37 search keywords.

## Architecture

### 3-Tier Model Routing

The core optimization is routing each job to the cheapest model that can handle it accurately.

### Optimization Layers (Compounding)

Three systems work together to drive down cost:

1. **Prompt caching** (`lib/cache-manager.mjs`) — Marks system prompt + profile context with `cache_control: ephemeral`. Break-even at call #2, profitable from call #3. Saves ~40% tokens on repeated context.
2. **Model routing** (`lib/model-router.mjs`) — Routes each job to Haiku/Sonnet/Opus based on actual signal, not blanket rules.
3. **Semantic dedup** (`lib/semantic-dedup.mjs`) — Pure JS TF-IDF cosine similarity (no external APIs). Threshold 0.82. Catches cross-platform duplicate listings before they consume any eval tokens.

## Token Optimization

Three compounding layers — prompt caching + model routing + semantic dedup — produce results that are not additive, they multiply.

| Scenario | Before | After | Reduction |
|----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Single evaluation | 8,200 tokens | 2,100 tokens | 74% |
| Hard-skip (Haiku) | 8,200 tokens | 380 tokens | 95% |
| Daily scan (30 jobs) | 246,000 tokens | 38,400 tokens | 84% |
| 45 applications | 720,000 tokens | 40,500 tokens | 94% |
| Full pipeline (205 jobs) | 1,681,000 tokens | 298,000 tokens | 82% |
| **Monthly cost** | **$18.48** | **$2.72** | **85%** |

**Why the savings compound:**
- Prompt caching removes repeated context overhead on every call after the first
- Model routing sends 60-70% of jobs to Haiku instead of Sonnet before they ever reach full evaluation
- Semantic dedup prevents duplicate jobs from reaching the routing layer at all
- Answer bank pre-generates standard application answers once, eliminating per-application LLM calls entirely

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/maddykws/jubilant-waddle.git
cd jubilant-waddle && npm install
npx playwright install chromium   # Required for PDF generation and portal scanning

# 2. Configure
cp config/profile.example.yml config/profile.yml  # Edit with your details
cp templates/portals.example.yml portals.yml       # Customize companies to scan

# 3. Open Claude Code in this directory
claude

# Claude will detect the system is not set up and walk you through onboarding:
# - Paste or describe your CV → creates cv.md
# - Answer a few questions → fills config/profile.yml
# - Portal config is set up automatically
```

**The system onboards itself.** On first run, Claude detects missing files and guides you step by step through CV, profile, and portal setup before doing anything else.

**The system is designed to be customized by Claude itself.** Modes, archetypes, scoring weights, negotiation scripts — just ask. Claude reads the same files it uses, so it knows exactly what to edit.

```
"Change the archetypes to data engineering roles"
"Add these 10 companies to my portal scanner"
"Update my CV with this new role I just started"
"Translate the modes to French"
"Adjust scoring weights to prioritize remote-first companies"
```

## New Features Deep Dive

### Apply Automation

The answer bank + apply agent combination reduces application effort from 20+ minutes to under 5.

1. Run `npm run answer-bank generate` once. This makes a single Sonnet call and saves 25 pre-generated answers for standard questions ("Tell me about yourself", "Why this company", "Describe a challenge you overcame") to `data/answer-bank.json`.
2. When applying, `npm run apply 028` runs a 9-step flow: navigate to the form → snapshot → Haiku classifies each field (~300 tokens) → standard fields are filled from answer bank (0 tokens) → custom/role-specific questions go to Sonnet (~600 tokens) → screenshot for review → STOP.
3. You review and click Submit yourself. The agent never does.

Total cost per application: ~900 tokens. Naive approach: ~16,000 tokens. 94% reduction.

### Intelligence Features

**Ghost Detector** scores job postings on 7 signals before spending evaluation tokens. Any listing scoring ≥6 is skipped immediately. Typical ghost signals: the posting is >90 days old (+3 points), it comes from a staffing agency (+2), or contains clearance/layoff language (+2). Running this on your pipeline before batch evaluation can eliminate 20-30% of listings as dead.

**Funding Radar** monitors RSS feeds from TechCrunch AI, VentureBeat AI, and Crunchbase News. It filters for Series B+, >$20M rounds in AI/ML/LLM companies and saves results to `reports/funding-radar-{date}.md`. Companies that just closed a round typically hire aggressively 60-90 days later — before jobs appear on boards.

**ATS Optimizer** analyzes your generated CV against a specific JD using Haiku. It extracts the top 20 keywords from the JD and checks keyword density, section header conventions, date formatting, and bullet structure (action verb → metric → result). Returns a score 0-100 with specific gaps to fix.

### Analytics

**Funnel Dashboard** (`npm run dashboard`) generates a self-contained `dashboard/funnel.html` file with Chart.js visualizations: pipeline funnel with stage conversion rates, score distribution histogram, H1B/visa eligibility breakdown, company tier heatmap, daily application rate line chart, location breakdown, and a prioritized action items list.

**Rejection Analyzer** (`npm run rejection-analysis`) needs at least 10 rejections to run meaningfully. It groups rejections by company size, location, score range at application time, and role type, then runs time-to-rejection analysis. It outputs 3-5 specific, actionable recommendations to `reports/rejection-analysis-{date}.md`. Run this monthly to recalibrate your targeting.

**Follow-up Scheduler** tracks which applications are at day 7, 14, or 21 since submission. `npm run follow-up check` shows what needs attention. `npm run follow-up message 028` generates a personalized 3-sentence follow-up via Sonnet using the original JD context.

### New Modes

**negotiate** — Full salary negotiation framework. Extracts the offer into a structured table, benchmarks against Levels.fyi/Glassdoor/Blind comps for the role and location, analyzes your BATNA, generates an opening anchor script targeting 10-15% above the offer, prepares pushback responses for 5 common counter-arguments, sets a walk-away threshold, and outputs a ready-to-send negotiation email.

**interview** — Pre-interview intelligence briefing. Researches the company, generates 10 technical questions drawn directly from the JD, 5 behavioral questions, maps 3 of your strongest STAR stories from `interview-prep/story-bank.md` to the role's key requirements, and suggests 5 sharp questions to ask the interviewer. Saved to `interview-prep/{num}-{company}-prep.md`.

**compare** — Offer comparison with financial modeling. Normalizes total comp across salary/equity/bonus, applies cost-of-living adjustment (NYC/SF/Remote tiers), applies equity risk discount by company stage, and builds a 4-year scenario model with conservative/base/optimistic projections for each offer. Outputs a ranked recommendation with rationale.

**outreach** — Cold outreach assistant. Researches the target's LinkedIn profile, drafts a 4-sentence personalized message, generates a <300 character connection note, and creates a follow-up template. Logs all outreach to `data/outreach-log.md` to prevent duplicate contacts.
